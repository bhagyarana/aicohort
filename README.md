# Agentic AI Training

Master the art of building intelligent AI agents — from foundational concepts to production-ready systems.

## Overview

A comprehensive, cohort-based training program designed to teach developers how to build intelligent AI agents using modern frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and various LLM providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic, Groq).

## What You'll Learn

- **LangChain Fundamentals** — Prompt templates, LCEL, output parsers
- **Advanced LangChain** — Embeddings, vector stores, RAG pipelines
- **LangGraph Essentials** — Graph architecture, state management, conditional flows
- **Agents, Tools & MCP** — ReAct agents, custom tools, multi-agent systems
- **Production Patterns** — Deployment, monitoring, testing, security

## Course Structure

```
Week 1-2: Foundations (Modules 1-2)
Week 3-4: Agent Development (Modules 3-5)
Week 5-6: Implementation (Agent Patterns + Capstone)
```

| Component | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| 5 Modules | 90 minutes each with theory + hands-on labs |
| 3 Agent Patterns | ReAct, Tool-Using, Multi-Agent implementations |
| 1 Capstone Project | Build your own production-ready agent |
